### Description
This is a Python script that simplifies polynomials by combining like terms and expanding parentheses. The script takes a polynomial expression as input and outputs its simplified form.
 

### Motivation
I created this script out of boredom one afternoon and thought it might be useful for others who need to simplify polynomials quickly and easily. While I don't usually upload things to Github, I thought this could be a fun project to share with others who might find it helpful.
